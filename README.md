###Expansion Pack for Game Dev Tycoon (Current Version 1.1.5)

This is my overal expansion pack for Game Dev Tycoon.
It is made with the intention of being the best content-adding mod in the GDT community and so far I think we're doing a great job at that because with plenty new topics, platforms, events, custom computers, custom prices and many more this mod will make a new gameplay a very entertaining one 

Note: [This mod requires UltimateLib](http://gdt-ultimatesuite.abesco.de/)

This expansion pack will include:
  - 80 New topics
  - 11 New platforms
  - 8 New events
  - 22 custom Researches
  - Custom prices
  - Black Bull (energy drink for your staff)
  - Custom Computers
  - Possibility to search for a certain topic when you start creating a game
  - Game difficulties (easy, normal, hard)

###Change Log

Version 1.1.5
  - Added custom difficulties.
  - Requirement for UltimateLib.

Version 1.1.0
  - SirEverard optimized the search bar to look like the wat it's supposed to be.

Version 1.0.0
  - Added search bar in the topic menu when creating a game for easy topic finding. (+ starting fresh with version number)

Version 0.5.0
  - Added custom computers. In the hardware lab, you can now make your own computers. You have multiple options for OS, CPU, Motherboard, GPU, RAM and Storage. You can select from 18 awesome cases which get progressively cooler (like with custom consoles). All the credit for the textures goes to silverwolf (Greenheart Games Forum name)!
	- New license
	
Version 0.3.4
  - Added "Black Bull". Black Bull is an energy drink that you can buy for you staff when they get tired. It will give them some energy. But won't make them as fresh as sending them on a vacation.

Version 0.3.3
  - Made some modifications to the custom prices
  - Beta R&D Lab research (you can research the option but can't use it in your engine. Maybe someone can help me fix that)
  - 3 New platforms (Textures made by @Gamingthrou) So unfortunately you have to start a new save game. Note to      developers of GDT: Maybe you can fix it in the API so people don't have to start a new game when a new platform is added ^^

Version 0.3.2
  - Added custom prices. UI techniques based on @kristof1104 cheat mod (Go check it out it's a great mod)
  - 2 New awesome events. Made by: @Nezaja
  - 3 New researches + 1 new platform. Made by: @nathan00107
