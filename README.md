### Expansion Pack for Game Dev Tycoon (Current Version 1.2.0)


This is my overall expansion pack for Game Dev Tycoon.
It has been made with the intention of being the best content-adding mod in the GDT community and so far I think we're doing a great job at that - there are plenty of new topics, platforms, events as well as custom computers and custom prices and much more. All this ensures that this mod will make each new playthrough a very entertaining one.

Note: This mod requires [UltimateLib](http://gdt-ultimatesuite.abesco.de/) (Works with the [iSlay's uploaded version](https://forum.greenheartgames.com/t/rel-tools-ultimatesuite-ultimatelib-1-3-4/9855/521) ) 

This expansion pack includes:
  - 80 new topics
  - 11 new platforms
  - 8 new events
  - 22 new research topics
  - Custom prices
  - Black Bull (energy drink for your staff)
  - Custom Computers
  - The ability to search through topics
  - Game difficulties (easy, normal, hard)

### Change Log
Version 1.2.0
  - Added keyboards, mice and headsets to custom computers.
  - Added 3 new textures to the custom computers.

Version 1.1.5
  - Added custom difficulties.
  - Requirement for UltimateLib.

Version 1.1.0
  - SirEverard optimized the search bar to look how it's supposed to.

Version 1.0.0
  - Added search bar in the topic menu when creating a game for easy topic finding. (+ starting fresh with version number)

Version 0.5.0
  - Added custom computers. In the hardware lab, you can now make your own computers. You have multiple options for OS, CPU, Motherboard, GPU, RAM and Storage. You can select from 18 awesome cases which get progressively cooler (like with custom consoles). All the credit for the textures goes to silverwolf (Greenheart Games Forum name)!
	- New license
	
Version 0.3.4
  - Added "Black Bull". Black Bull is an energy drink that you can buy for your staff when they get tired. It will give them some energy, but not quite as much as sending them on a vacation.

Version 0.3.3
  - Made some modifications to the custom prices
  - Beta R&D Lab research (you can research the option but can't use it in your engine. Maybe someone can help me fix that)
  - 3 new platforms (Textures made by @Gamingthrou) Unfortunately you have to start a new save game for these to take effect. Note to the developers of GDT: maybe you can fix it in the API so that people don't have to start a new game when a new platform is added ^^

Version 0.3.2
  - Added custom prices. UI techniques based on @kristof1104's cheat mod (Go check it out, it's a great mod!)
  - 2 new awesome events. Made by: @Nezaja
  - 3 new research topics + 1 new platform. Made by: @nathan00107
